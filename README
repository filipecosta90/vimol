Vimol is a powerful vi-inspired molecular viewer and editor.
For information and tutorials on using vimol consult online documentation at

To compile vimol from source you will need an ANSI C complaint compiler and a
make utility. You will also need the following dependencies installed along
with their corresponding development packages:

 * Cairo graphics library (cairographics.org). Version 1.12.0 or
   newer is recommended.

	OpenBSD:  pkg_add cairo

	FreeBSD:  pkg install cairo

	Ubuntu:   apt-get install libcairo-dev

	Fedora:   yum install cairo-devel

 * Simple direct-media layer (libsdl.org). Version 2.0.1 or newer is
   recommended. Make sure that the video support is turned on if building SDL
   from source.

	OpenBSD:  pkg_add sdl2

	FreeBSD:  pkg install sdl2

	Ubuntu:   apt-get install libsdl2-dev

	Fedora:   yum install SDL2-devel

After installing all dependencies, compile vimol by typing:

	make

To install the vimol binary issue:
